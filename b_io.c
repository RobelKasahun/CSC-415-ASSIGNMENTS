 * Project:: Assignment 5 â€“ Buffered I/O read
 *
 * File:: b_io.c
 *
 * Description:: The aim of this assignment is to be the routines 
 * 				 that we have been using to open a file, read 
 * 				 number of bytes from the file, and closing 
 * 				 freeing used resources, therefore, the assignment
 * 			     is to implement the open(), read(), and close()
 * 				 functions from scratch.
